                        <p><strong>Contemplative research-creation</strong> might be understood as an approach that weaves together a mindful, caring inquiry into lived experience with artistic experimentation, often leveraging the potential of emerging technologies. </p>
                        <p>This process allows me to produce artistic expressions (interactive media, biofeedback systems, etc.) that are themselves situated forms of knowledge, while simultaneously opening up perspectives on futures of Neuro-AI research and pushing the boundaries of co/creativity.</p>

                    <div class="insight-text">
                        <p><strong> Computational Sensory Ethnography</strong>, in my practice, is a methodology where speculative (co-)design drives the computational exploration and artistic rendering of sensory data gathered ethnographically. This allows me to produce and communicate knowledge about consciousness, life, and technology in ways that challenge conventional artistic expression and open up new, innovative paradigms for research implicating human subjects.</p>

                    <div class="insight-text">
                        <p>I see contemplative research-creation at the nexus of <strong>Neurotech and GenAI</strong> as a practice where I use speculative (co-)design to investigate how these technologies can be combined to explore the very nature of consciousness and augment human experience (i.e. specifically, for the case of sensory ethnography). </p>
                        <p>Through artistic creation, I generate insights into the possibilities and implications of these powerful tools, pushing artistic limits and seeking novel research approaches to fundamental questions about life and mind.</p>

                    <div class="insight-text">
                        <p>I understand <strong>Speculative (co-)design</strong> as a shared journey into potential "new-old" ways of being, using design as our vehicle. Together, we can collaboratively envision alternative societal structures, human-technology relationships, or even ways of understanding consciousness, life, and art that might emerge in the future, leading to the development of innovative paradigms for both living and researching.</p>

                    <p class="insight-date"><time datetime="2025-04-19">April 19th, 2025</time></p>
                    <div class="insight-text">
                        <p>Expectations are fallible. Even when you are prepared and disillusioned by the fact that technology often never works as expected, expectations are still inaccurate. They still fall short of fitting with given circumstances.</p>
                        <p>It is a good thing too, because sometimes it means we can be pleasantly surprised. This bears resonance with my mindfulness practice. I realized some years ago that it's contrary to the intent, ineffective, unnecessary, or even harmful to use this consciousness-altering practice as a means to an end, as a way to fulfill a goal. The practice is the goal in itself.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, asking technology to comply is inherently a colonial attitude, as it imposes expectations and demands on a system that is highly unpredictable itself.</p>
